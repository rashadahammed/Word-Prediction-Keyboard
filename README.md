Wow, capstone looks rather complex. NLP is completely new field for me. I need to start from scratch with theory. My goal today is to download data and search for data sources about NLP.
Downloading and unzipping of data takes ages.

A "corpus" (plural: "corpora") is a collection of written or spoken texts, often used for linguistic analysis, language research, and machine learning applications. Corpora serve as valuable resources for studying various aspects of language, such as vocabulary, grammar, syntax, semantics, and discourse patterns.

Here are some key points about corpora:

    Diversity of Texts: Corpora can encompass a wide range of texts, including books, articles, speeches, interviews, social media posts, transcripts, and more. The texts in a corpus can be from a single source or multiple sources, depending on the research goals.

    Structured Data: Corpora are typically organized in a structured manner, allowing researchers to access and analyze the text data systematically. This structured format might include metadata such as authorship, publication date, and genre labels.

    Language Study: Linguists and language researchers use corpora to investigate various linguistic phenomena, such as word frequency, collocations (words that often appear together), language variation, and language change over time.

    NLP (Natural Language Processing): Corpora are essential for training and evaluating natural language processing (NLP) models, including machine learning algorithms, chatbots, and language translation systems. NLP researchers use corpora to build models that can understand and generate human language.

    Language Resources: Corpora are valuable resources for developing language resources like dictionaries, thesauri, and language teaching materials. Lexicographers often use corpora to identify words' meanings, usages, and common contexts.

    Applications: Corpora find applications in various fields, including computational linguistics, sentiment analysis, text classification, and information retrieval. They are also used in forensic linguistics to analyze text evidence in legal cases.

    Representative Sampling: It's important for corpora to represent the language or domain they aim to study accurately. Researchers carefully select texts to ensure that the corpus is a representative sample of the language they want to analyze.

In summary, corpora play a crucial role in understanding and studying language, aiding linguistic research, and enabling the development of language-related technologies. They serve as comprehensive collections of textual data that facilitate insights into the structure and usage of languages.

I have been studying basics of NLP in last 10 days. It is pretty new topic for me. Looks like there are two packages which I might be interested in - tm and quanteda. I need to progress in week 2 tasks, already late.

################## 12.10.2023 ##################
I finished milestone report. I was a lot of work at new topic for me. I am happy that I was able to finish it. My next step is to learn more about word prediction models.
