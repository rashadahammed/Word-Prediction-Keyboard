## Introduction to WordPred

This project is the final part of a 10 courseÂ [Data Science track by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science). Asignment was to clean and analyze a large corpus of unstructured text and build a word prediction model and use it in a web application.

-   My Shiny app WordPred is available [here](https://pavel-droid.shinyapps.io/WordPred/).

-   Code used to prepare model, create an app is available [here](https://github.com/Pavel-droid/SwiftKey-Capstone).

I hope you are going to enjoy my work.

## Data preparation

30000 lines from three files with natural language data have been used.

Corpus, tokens, n-grams and document feature matrixes have been created

-   tokens have been cleaned - removed numbers, punctuation, urls, symbols, stemmed

Data tables with words of n-grams and n-gram frequencies have been created and saved as rds files.

## Predictive model

-   **N-Gram Model:** The model utilizes n-grams, capturing contextual information by considering sequences of consecutive words.

-   **Back-Off Strategy:** Implements a back-off algorithm to handle unseen n-grams, gracefully falling back to lower-order n-grams in case of sparse data or missing probabilities.

-   **Probabilistic Prediction:** Predicts the probability of the next word in a sequence based on the context of the preceding words, enabling language prediction in natural language processing tasks.

## Model accuracy 

Each box is average result of 10x1000 predictions from one, two, three words as input.

## Conclusions

-   I created working word predicting model, using n-grams and back-off algorithm.

-   Accuracy of this model is not great, as it uses very limited corpus and it is also built on simple n-gram prediction.

-   There are for sure plenty of other approaches to make it more accurate, but this was not a target of this project.
